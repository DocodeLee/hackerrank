## i solved 5 problems in hackerrank and feel like to share the process in hackerrank so...
## these are the result

# Write a Function
### An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day. In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
### The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
### The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
### The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
### This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years

### Final : need to add condtiion by "or"

# Runner-up Score
### Runner up score is the second place score
### Store the score in the map and find the runner up score

### because they gave the map we need to change to the list to handle this
### and set the value as max_score and need to delete all the max_score in the list
### i chose to use while loop to delete the duplication of the max_score
### and then print the max score this max will be the second

# Nested Lists
### Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
### Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

### first i tried to find the way how to call only the score

### Finally i can print the target but i need to sort as alphabet sequence
### when you need to sort use this  sorted()
