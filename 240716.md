### alphabet = [chr(i) for i in range(97, 123)][:size]
### [:size] used to slice the list
### alphabet.reverse() > because we use the last order alphabet if size is 3 we use from "c", if size is "5" we use from "e"

### I tried to solve this problem by split() and for statement but it only solve few problem
### I think if there are muliple spaces this code doesn't work
